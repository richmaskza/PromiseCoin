# PromiseCoin

Introduction
PromiseCoin is a BEP20 token that allows individuals and businesses to make financial commitments through secure and accountable means. The token eliminates the need for cash, traditional banking, or financial institutions, and provides a solution for making payments even without physical money available.

How PromiseCoin Works
With PromiseCoin, you can increase trust and accountability in financial transactions while streamlining the process of making and tracking promises. Whether you are a startup, songwriter/producer, looking to pay lobola, or making everyday promises, PromiseCoin has you covered.

Real-World Applications
Here are a few examples of how PromiseCoin can be used in everyday situations:
* Startups: A startup can use PromiseCoin to pay salaries to employees as a promise to pay. The employees receive the tokens and once the startup has enough funds, they can exchange the tokens for the promised amount in cash.
* Songwriters: A songwriter can release a new track in exchange for promises from an Artist. Artists can make promises to pay for the track in the future and the songwriter can release the track once they receive the promised tokens.
* Lobola: PromiseCoin can be used to pay lobola, a traditional African custom of paying a bride price. The groom's family can make a promise to pay using PromiseCoin, and the bride's family can receive the tokens as a secure and accountable way to track the promise.
* Everyday promises: PromiseCoin can be used in everyday situations where one person makes a promise to pay another person a certain amount in the future. This provides a secure and accountable way to keep track of the promise.
